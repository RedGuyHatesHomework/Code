# Hi!
This is RedGuyHatesHomework's GitHub page where my code organization and style is seen.

To navigate through my GitHub page, you'll need to use my Roblox portfolio's (redguy-luau.carrd.co) "Past work" section.

Just find the folder which has the name of the work, click on it, and you can choose to see an image of the work's explorer. All of the scripts shown in the explorer are available in that folder!
